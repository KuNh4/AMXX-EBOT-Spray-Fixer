# AMXX EBOT Spray Fixer
This AMX Mod X plugin was made for E-BOT 1.07 LEGACY R12.

It makes bots spray when holding automatic weapons instead of tap/burst shooting.

- ebot_spray_debug 0 // Debug mode for testing
- 
- ebot_spray_type 1 // 1 - Distance based spray | 2 - Aim based spray

- 
- ebot_spray_min_time 0.3 // Minimum Spray Time (in seconds)

ebot_spray_type 2 if bot has crosshair on target shoots otherwise stops, similar behavior to 1
